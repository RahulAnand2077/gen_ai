When he is ambushed by a team of mercenaries on the Autobahn, he realizes the package contains codes for a prototype weapon.

Mistaken for the eccentric wedding planner who went missing, Dave is forced to make split-second decisions about floral arrangements and seating charts to avoid being thrown out. As the ceremony descends into chaos involving a runaway llama and a chocolate fountain explosion, Dave tries to keep up the charade long enough to impress a bridesmaid, only to realize the real planner has just arrived.\",\n",

Realizing they are not alone in the caves, the survivors must climb back to the surface before the thing in the deep steals their voices—and their lives—forever.\"\n",
