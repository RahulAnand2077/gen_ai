      "    1.  **Base Case**: If the input string `s` is empty (length 0) or contains\n",
      "        only one character (length 1), it is already considered \"reversed\".\n",

      "\n",
      "    2.  **Recursive Step**: If the string `s` has more than one character:\n",
      "        a.  We identify the *first character* of the string: `s[0]`.\n",
      "        b.  We identify the *rest of the string* (all characters except the first): `s[1:]`.\n",
      "        c.  The function then makes a recursive call to `recursive_reverse_string`\n",
      "            with `s[1:]`. This call will eventually return the reversed version\n",
      "            of the rest of the string.\n",
      "        d.  Finally, it concatenates the result from the recursive call (the\n",
      "            reversed `s[1:]`) with the `s[0]` (the original first character).\n",
      "            By appending `s[0]` to the end of the reversed `s[1:]`, we effectively\n",
      "            move `s[0]` from the front to the back of the entire string,\n",
